= canned_responses

Store and use prepared (canned) responses, per-project or globally.

For Redmine versions prior to 2.x, check out the pre-2.x branch.

= Installation

The usual {installation instructions}[http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Plugins]
for Redmine plugins apply. The (very brief) summary:
Download or git clone to the plugins directory, run `rake
redmine:plugins:migrate` to create database tables.

Enable the 'Canned Responses' module for projects you need this
feature in.

= Note on the Fork

This fork was created for use in ProCommerz production process, so that canned texts can be used 
more across the whole workflow, not just for issue updates.
